## Overview

This documentation provides a detailed analysis of the bottlenecks identified, the benchmarking methodology, performance metrics before and after optimizations, and justification for the optimization choices made. It also discusses potential further improvements.

## Bottlenecks Identified

### Order Placement Latency
- **Observation:** The process of placing orders (both market and limit) exhibited delays, especially during CURL network operations.
- **Bottleneck:** Network communication overhead, including DNS resolution and connection establishment.
- **Solution:** Implement connection reuse, persistent connections, and optimized CURL options.

### Market Data Processing Latency
- **Observation:** Fetching and parsing market data showed significant delays.
- **Bottleneck:** JSON parsing and data processing from the API response.
- **Solution:** Use more efficient JSON libraries and reduce unnecessary parsing operations.

### Thread Management
- **Observation:** Task execution using the thread pool revealed potential thread contention and overhead from task synchronization.
- **Bottleneck:** Synchronization mechanisms like mutexes can cause delays.
- **Solution:** Adopt lock-free data structures where possible and optimize thread pool task management.

### Memory Management
- **Observation:** Memory allocation and deallocation, especially during high-frequency operations, caused performance degradation.
- **Bottleneck:** Frequent allocation/deallocation from the heap.
- **Solution:** Use custom memory pools for efficient memory management.

## Benchmarking Methodology

### Setup
- Each metric was measured using high-resolution timers (`std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`) and logged for analysis.
- Benchmarks were run under controlled conditions to ensure consistent results.

### Metrics
- **Order Placement Latency:** Time taken to place market and limit orders.
- **Market Data Processing Latency:** Time taken to fetch and parse market data.
- **WebSocket Message Propagation Delay:** Time taken for messages to propagate from WebSocket server to client.
- **End-to-End Trading Loop Latency:** Total time taken for a complete trading operation loop from order placement to order execution.

### Measurement Process
- **Baseline Measurements:** Initial benchmarks were performed without any optimizations to establish baseline metrics.
- **Iterative Optimization:** Each optimization was applied incrementally, and metrics were re-evaluated after each change to measure improvements.
- **Final Measurements:** Comprehensive benchmarks were performed post-optimizations to capture the overall performance gains.

## Optimization Choices and Justification

### Memory Management
- **Optimization Choice:** Custom Memory Pools
  - **Justification:** Custom memory pools significantly reduce the overhead associated with frequent memory allocations and deallocations from the heap. By pre-allocating a pool of memory blocks, the application can quickly allocate and deallocate memory without the usual overhead. This is particularly beneficial in high-frequency trading systems where performance is critical.
  - **Implementation:**

  ```cpp
  MemoryPool::MemoryPool(size_t blockSize, size_t blockCount) : blockSize(blockSize), blockCount(blockCount) {
      memory = new char[blockSize * blockCount];
      for (size_t i = 0; i < blockCount; ++i) {
          freeBlocks.push_back(memory + i * blockSize);
      }
  }

  MemoryPool::~MemoryPool() {
      delete[] memory;
  }

  void* MemoryPool::allocate() {
      std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(poolMutex);
      if (freeBlocks.empty()) {
          std::cerr << "Memory pool exhausted" << std::endl;
          return nullptr;
      }
      void* ptr = freeBlocks.back();
      freeBlocks.pop_back();
      return ptr;
  }

  void MemoryPool::deallocate(void* ptr) {
      std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(poolMutex);
      freeBlocks.push_back(ptr);
  }
  ```

### Network Communication
- **Optimization Choice:** Persistent Connections and Optimized CURL Options
  - **Justification:** Maintaining persistent connections reduces the overhead of repeatedly establishing and tearing down connections. Optimizing CURL options, such as disabling Nagleâ€™s algorithm, setting appropriate timeouts, and enabling HTTP/2, improves the performance of network communication.
  - **Implementation:**

  ```cpp
  void CurlConnectionManager::setupCurlOptions(CURL* handle) {
      curl_easy_reset(handle);
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 0L);
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_TCP_NODELAY, 1L); // Disable Nagle's algorithm
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS, 2000L); // Set timeout to 2 seconds
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS, 1000L); // Set connection timeout to 1 second
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L); // Follow redirections
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS, 3L); // Maximum redirections
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT, 3600L); // DNS cache timeout
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PIPEWAIT, 1L); // Wait for pipe/multiplex
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, 1L); // Enable SSL peer verification
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE, 0L); // Do not close connection after use
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION, CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0); // Use HTTP/2 for better performance
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 2L); // Set overall timeout to 2 seconds
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_EXPECT_100_TIMEOUT_MS, 500L); // Reduce timeout for 100-continue responses
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HEADEROPT, CURLHEADER_UNIFIED); // Optimize header processing
      curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1L); // Enable header output
  }
  ```

### Data Structure Selection
- **Optimization Choice:** Lock-Free Data Structures
  - **Justification:** Lock-free data structures minimize synchronization overhead, allowing for efficient concurrency. They are particularly useful in high-performance applications where avoiding locks can reduce contention and improve throughput.
  - **Implementation:**

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  void LockFreeQueue<T>::enqueue(T value) {
      std::shared_ptr<Node> new_node = std::make_shared<Node>(value);
      std::shared_ptr<Node> old_tail;

      while (true) {
          old_tail = tail;
          std::shared_ptr<Node> tail_next = old_tail->next;
          if (old_tail == tail) {
              if (tail_next == nullptr) {
                  if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak(&old_tail->next, &tail_next, new_node)) {
                      break;
                  }
              } else {
                  std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak(&tail, &old_tail, tail_next);
              }
          }
      }
      std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak(&tail, &old_tail, new_node);
  }

  template <typename T>
  bool LockFreeQueue<T>::dequeue(T& result) {
      std::shared_ptr<Node> old_head;
      while (true) {
          old_head = head;
          std::shared_ptr<Node> tail = tail;
          std::shared_ptr<Node> head_next = old_head->next;

          if (old_head == head) {
              if (old_head == tail) {
                  if (head_next == nullptr) {
                      return false;
                  }
                  std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak(&tail, &tail, head_next);
              } else {
                  result = head_next->data;
                  if (std::atomic_compare_exchange_weak(&head, &old_head, head_next)) {
                      break;
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      return true;
  }
  ```

### Thread Management
- **Optimization Choice:** Thread Pool
  - **Justification:** A thread pool allows for efficient management of worker threads, reducing the overhead associated with creating and destroying threads. By reusing a pool of threads, the application can efficiently handle concurrent tasks.
  - **Implementation:**

  ```cpp
  ThreadPool::ThreadPool(size_t numThreads) : stop(false) {
      for (size_t i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
          workers.emplace_back([this] {
              while (true) {
                  std::function<void()> task;
                  {
                      std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
                      condition.wait(lock, [this] {
                          return stop || !tasks.empty();
                      });
                      if (stop && tasks.empty()) {
                          return;
                      }
                      task = std::move(tasks.front());
                      tasks.pop();
                  }
                  task();
              }
          });
      }
  }

  ThreadPool::~ThreadPool() {
      {
          std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
          stop = true;
      }
      condition.notify_all();
      for (std::thread& worker : workers) {
          worker.join();
      }
  }

  void ThreadPool::enqueue(std::function<void()> task) {
      {
          std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
          if (stop) {
              throw std::runtime_error("enqueue on stopped ThreadPool");
          }
                    tasks.emplace(task);
      }
      condition.notify_one();
  }

  void ThreadPool::workerThread() {
      while (true) {
          function<void()> task;
          {
              unique_lock<mutex> lock(queueMutex);
              condition.wait(lock, [this] { return stop || !tasks.empty(); });
              if (stop && tasks.empty()) return;
              task = move(tasks.front());
              tasks.pop();
          }
          task();
      }
  }

  ```



### CPU Optimization
- **Optimization Choice:** Asynchronous Tasks and Parallel Execution
  - **Justification:** Using asynchronous tasks and parallel execution helps to leverage the CPUâ€™s capabilities fully, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks and reducing overall latency.
  - **Implementation:**
  ```cpp
  bool OrderAPI::performAsyncCurlRequest(const std::string& url, const std::string& accessToken, std::string& response) {
      auto task = std::async(std::launch::async, [&]() {
          return performCurlRequest(url, accessToken, response);
      });
      return task.get();
  }

  bool OrderAPI::performBatchAsyncCurlRequest(const std::vector<std::string>& urls, const std::string& accessToken, std::vector<std::string>& responses) {
      std::vector<std::future<bool>> futures;
      for (const auto& url : urls) {
          futures.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async, [&]() {
              std::string response;
              bool result = performCurlRequest(url, accessToken, response);
              responses.push_back(std::move(response));
              return result;
          }));
      }
      bool allSuccessful = true;
      for (auto& future : futures) {
          allSuccessful &= future.get();
      }
      return allSuccessful;
  }
  ```
